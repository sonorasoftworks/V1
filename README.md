# Sonora


## What is Sonora?

**Sonora** is a blazingly fast and stable web proxy built to prioritize your privacy. By leveraging advanced obfuscation techniques, Sonora makes it difficult for trackers and monitors to detect your web traffic, ensuring a higher degree of anonymity.

## Features

- **About:Blank Cloaks**: A pretty simple trick that basically hides the website completely from your search history
- **Randomized Bare Servers**: Randomizes the Bare Server on server startup which makes it harder to detect
- **Easy to Deploy**: Simple installation and configuration process suitable for both beginners and experts.
- **Chat Platform**: Ability to chat with other users that are using the site...
- **Log Free**: We do not monitor or steal your data so we completely do not log your data

## Installation

To install Sonora, follow these steps:


### Manual Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sonorasoftworks/sonora.git
   cd sonora
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```


## Usage

Once Sonora is up and running, you can start using it to browse the web privately:

1. **Set up your browser**: Once you got official confirmation that the server is officially running you may head over to `localhost` And depending on what port the console logged you can go to that port .
    -Example
    `localhost:8080`

2. **Visit websites**: Navigate to websites as usual. Sonora will automatically handle the proxying and obfuscation of your traffic.
